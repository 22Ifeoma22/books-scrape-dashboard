### 💡 Result
- On GitHub, this will show exactly like your screenshot (black boxes with “Copy code” buttons).  
- Visitors will instantly know how to **run your scraper and dashboard**.  
- It makes your project look **professional and ready-to-use** ✅.

👉 Do you want me to rewrite your full `README.md` so it includes:
- Project description  
- Features (Scraper → CSV → Dashboard)  
- Installation steps  
- Run instructions (like above)  
- Example screenshots placeholders  

That way, your repo will look polished and recruiter-ready.
