### 💡 Result
- On GitHub, this will show exactly like your screenshot (black boxes with “Copy code” buttons).

- It makes your project look **professional and ready-to-use** ✅.

👉 Do you want me to rewrite your full `README.md` so it includes:
- Project description  
- Features (Scraper → CSV → Dashboard)  
- Installation steps  
- Run instructions (like above)  
- Example screenshots placeholders  

That way, your repo will look polished and recruiter-ready.

✨ With this, your repo will look **super professional** — badges on top, clear usage steps, screenshots placeholders, everything neat.

Do you want me to also **generate badges for last commit & repo size** (they auto-update on GitHub)?
